# Template Usage

This folder is a project template for the CLI generator. To use this template:

1. Run the CLI script:
   ```
   npm run init
   ```
2. Enter the output folder (or leave blank for current directory).
3. Enter your project name.
4. The CLI will copy this template, set up your project name in `package.json`, install dependencies, and initialize a git repository.

## What gets replaced
- The `name` and `description` fields in `package.json` will be set to your chosen project name.

## After generation
- Start developing in your new project folder!
- See the generated `README.md` in your new project for more details about the stack and structure.

For more details on the stack and best practices, see the main `README.md` in this template.
